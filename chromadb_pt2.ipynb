StatesLanguageEnglishBudget 20 million 2 Box office 98 7 million 3 Spotlight is a 2015 American biographical drama film directed by Tom McCarthy and written by McCarthy and Josh Singer 4 5 The film follows The Boston Globe s Spotlight team the oldest continuously operating newspaper investigative journalist unit in the United States 6 and its investigation into a decades long coverup of widespread and systemic child sex abuse by numerous priests of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston Although the plot was original it is loosely based on a series of stories by the Spotlight team that earned The Globe the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service 7 The film features an ensemble cast including Mark Ruffalo Michael Keaton Rachel McAdams John Slattery Stanley Tucci Brian d Arcy James Liev Schreiber and Billy Crudup 8 Spotlight was shown in the Out of Competition section of the 72nd Venice International Film Festival 9 the Telluride Film Festival and the Special Presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival 10 It was released on November 6 2015 by Open Road Films and grossed 98 million worldwide 3 It received widespread critical praise with critics lauding the performances of the cast historical accuracy and screenplay it won numerous guilds and critics association awards and was named one of the best films of 2015 by various publications Spotlight won the Academy Award for Best Picture along with Best Original Screenplay from six total nominations making it the first Best Picture winner since The Greatest Show on Earth 1952 to win only one other Oscar The film also won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture Plot edit In 1976 at a Boston Police station two policemen discuss the arrest of Fr John Geoghan for child molestation A high ranking cleric talks to the mother of the victimized children An assistant district attorney then enters the precinct and tells the policemen not to let the press learn what has happened The arrest is not publicized and Geoghan is released In 2001 Marty Baron the new managing editor of The Boston Globe meets Walter Robby Robinson the editor of the newspaper s Spotlight investigative team After Baron reads a Globe article about a lawyer Mitchell Garabedian charging that Cardinal Bernard Law the Archbishop of Boston knew about Geoghan s sexual abuse of children and did nothing to stop it Baron urges the Spotlight team to investigate Journalist Michael Rezendes contacts Garabedian who initially declines to be interviewed Though he is told not to Rezendes reveals that he is on the Spotlight team and convinces Garabedian to talk Initially believing that they are following the story of one priest who was moved to new assignments several times the Spotlight team begin to uncover a pattern of sexual abuse by other priests in Massachusetts and an ongoing cover up by the Boston Archdiocese Through Phil Saviano who heads the victims rights group Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests SNAP the team is led to widen their search to thirteen priests Richard Sipe a former priest who worked to rehabilitate sexually abusive priests tells them that his studies suggest that there are approximately 90 abusive priests in Boston 6 of priests Through their research the team develops a list of 87 names and begin to find victims to back up their suspicions As the team realizes the sheer scale of the investigation it begins to take a toll on their lives reporter Matt Carroll learns one of the priest rehabilitation centers is on the same block as his family s home but cannot tell his children or his neighbors to avoid spoiling the story reporter Sacha Pfeiffer finds herself unable to attend church with her grandmother Rezendes pushes to get the story out quickly to prevent further abuse and Robinson faces pushback from some of his close friends who he learns were complicit in covering up the abuse When the September 11 attacks occur the team is forced to de prioritize the story They regain momentum when Rezendes learns from Garabedian that there are publicly available documents that confirm Cardinal Law was made aware of the abuse and ignored it Although Rezendes argues vociferously to run the story immediately before more victims suffer and rival newspapers publish comparable articles Robinson steadfastly refuses arguing the team needs to research further so that the systemic problem can be more fully exposed After the Globe wins a case to have even more legal documents unsealed that provide the evidence of that larger picture the Spotlight team finally begins to write the story and plan to publish their findings in early 2002 As they are about to go to print Robinson admits that he learned during the investigation that he was sent a list of 20 sexually abusive priests by lawyer Eric MacLeish in 1993 on which Robinson never followed up Baron still commends Robinson and the Spotlight team s efforts to expose the crimes now The story goes to print with a weblink to the documents that expose Law s inaction and a phone number for victims of abusive priests The next morning the team is inundated with calls from victims coming forward to tell their stories A textual epilogue notes that Law resigned in December 2002 and was eventually promoted to the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome and presents a list of 105 U S communities and 101 others around the world where major scandals involving abuse by priests have taken place Cast edit Mark Ruffalo as Michael

Michael Countryman as Richard Gilman publisher of the Boston Globe Michael Cyril Creighton as Joe Crowley Laurie Heineman as Judge Constance Sweeney David Fraser as John Albano 20 Tim Progosh as Principal Bill Kemeza Jimmy LeBlanc as Patrick McSorley 21 Production edit Writing edit The film was written by Tom McCarthy and co writer Josh Singer When McCarthy was asked how he and his co author tackled the research and writing process he said As I said I passed turned down the film the first time That s probably some indication of how intimidating it was But I think as always with any big assignment once you get over that initial shock and awe of how much material there was to cover you start digging into the material and become really fascinated by and engaged with it and we did And yeah it was a lot of work but it was exciting work It was really interesting work parsing through details of not just the investigation but its findings and trying to determine what was most helpful in telling our story I think having two brains on it was somewhat helpful too because we could talk through it a lot So it wasn t just sitting alone in a room and jotting notes We were dialoguing a lot about it That particular collaboration did feel investigative and on some level seemed to parallel some of the collaboration of the reporters in that investigation So I think there was something about our collaboration that made that initial process more palatable on some level 22 Development edit McCarthy and Singer completed the script in June 2013 23 It was on the 2013 Black List of unproduced screenplays 24 Singer told Creative Screenwriting that one of his goals for the film was to highlight the power of journalism which he feels has been waning He explained This story isn t about exposing the Catholic Church We were not on some mission to rattle people s faith In fact Tom came from a Catholic family The motive was to tell the story accurately while showing the power of the newsroom something that s largely disappeared today This story is important Journalism is important and there is a deeper message in the story 25 Filming edit Principal photography began on September 24 2014 in Boston Massachusetts 26 and continued in October in Hamilton Ontario Filming took place at Fenway Park 27 the then current Boston Globe offices in Dorchester Boston 28 the Boston Public Library 29 and McMaster University in Hamilton Ontario 30 The film s editor Tom McArdle said of the post production process We edited for eight months We just wanted to keep refining the film We cut out five scenes plus some segments of other scenes Often we would just cut out a line or two to make a scene a little tighter 31 The Boston Police station depicted in the opening scene was filmed in Toronto at the former Toronto Police Service 11 Division station at 209 Mavety Street 32 and the former Sears building on Islington Avenue in Toronto was converted into a replica of the interior of the old Boston Globe where the bulk of the filming took place 33 The brief scene in which Rezendes watches a children s church choir perform Silent Night was filmed in St Basil s Church Toronto a Roman Catholic church on the University of Toronto campus Historical accuracy edit The visual blog Information is Beautiful deduced that while taking creative license into account the film was 76 2 accurate when compared to real life events summarizing that the only conceits are scenes of power figures warning off the journalists 34 The film depicts only the events leading up to the publication of the Spotlight team s first article whereas the team actually continued publishing follow up reports for nearly two years afterward As a result certain events are depicted as having happened earlier than they actually did including the scene where former priest Ronald H Paquin freely admits to molesting children and having been molested himself 35 While Sacha Pfeiffer did indeed write the numerous follow up reports on Paquin the interview depicted in the film was a blend of two interviews conducted by her and Steve Kurkjian both of which took place about a month after the events in the film Kurkjian played in the film by Gene Amoroso was a founding member of the Spotlight team before becoming the Globe s Washington bureau chief but rejoined the team after the first story was published to assist with further reporting on the abuses Pfeiffer and Kurkjian have said that the confession was a much more gradual process and Paquin did not just blurt it out the way he does in the film 35 36 A scene where Matt Carroll discovers one of the priest treatment centers is down the block from where he lives is based on an actual discovery he made during the investigation with one minor detail changed Carroll actually lived down the street from John Geoghan the priest whose case sparked the investigations This was changed as the filmmakers thought the image of Carroll putting Geoghan s photo on his refrigerator to warn his children would seem unrealistic 37 In a subplot Eric MacLeish claims he sent a list of 20 priests to the Globe in 1993 but the story was buried in Metro Robinson later admits he was the editor for Metro at the time and he likely overlooked the case While the Globe did publish an article about the list of 20 priests the Spotlight team did not learn this during their investigation MacLeish himself revealed the article s existence while being interviewed for the screenplay by McCarthy and Singer This revelation along with Robinson s response to the filmmakers inquiry was incorporated into the screenplay for dramatic purposes 38 Music edit Main article Spotlight soundtrack Release edit The film premiered to sustained applause at the Venice Film Festival and the audience erupted in laughter when the film reported that following the events in the film Cardinal Bernard Law was reassigned to a senior position of honor in Rome 9 It had a limited release on November 6 2015 with its U S release scheduled for three weeks later on November 25 39 Home media edit Spotlight was released by Universal Studios Home Entertainment on DVD and Blu ray in the United States on February 23 2016 40 Reception edit Box office edit Spotlight grossed 45 1 million in the United States and Canada and 53 2 million in other countries for a worldwide total of 98 3 million against a production budget of 20 million 3 The Hollywood Reporter calculated the film made a net profit of up to 10 million 41 In the opening weekend of its limited release the film grossed 295 009 from five theaters 59 002 average one of the highest per screen averages of any release of 2015 42 The film grossed 4 4 million in the first weekend during its wide release finishing 8th at the box office 43 Critical response edit The performances of Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams received widespread critical acclaim earning them Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress respectively Spotlight received widespread critical acclaim The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 97 based on 376 reviews with an average rating of 8 8 10 The website s summary of the critical consensus is that Spotlight gracefully handles the lurid details of its fact based story while resisting the temptation to lionize its heroes resulting in a drama that honors the audience as well as its real life subjects 44 On Metacritic the film has a score of 93 out of 100 based on 45 critics indicating universal acclaim 45 Variety s Justin Chang called the film a superbly controlled and engrossingly detailed account of the Boston Globe s Pulitzer Prize winning investigation into the widespread pedophilia scandals and subsequent cover ups within the Catholic Church 46 Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal wrote To turn a spotlight fittingly on Spotlight it s the year s best movie so far and a rarity among countless dramatizations that claim to be based on actual events 47 Mark Kermode of The Guardian gave it four out of five stars and praised Ruffalo s performance writing As for Mark Ruffalo he s the closest thing this ensemble cast has to a star turn a long suppressed outburst of emotion providing one of the film s few grandstanding showstoppers 48 Helen O Hara of Empire gave the movie four out of five stars and called it a grown up film about serious people that mercifully escapes any awards grabbing platitudes and more thrilling than most action movies 49 Richard Propes of The Independent Critic gave Spotlight four out of four marks and praised the screenplay and cast Spotlight is a nearly perfect example of what happens when the perfect filmmaker works with the perfect script and acquires the perfect cast and crew to bring a story to life 50 At the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival Spotlight finished third in the audience balloting for the People s Choice Award 51 Comparing Spotlight to The Post a similar period film about journalists critic Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert com expressed perplexity over critics muted praise for the latter film writing that in terms of direction Spotlight got praise for doing a tenth of what Steven Spielberg does here 52 53 Top ten lists edit Spotlight was included on many critics top ten lists 54 1st Peter Travers

Top 10 listed alphabetically Steven Rea Philadelphia Inquirer Best of 2015 listed alphabetically not ranked Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Reactions from the Catholic Church edit In general the film was positively received by the Catholic community Before its release Cardinal Sean O Malley of the Archdiocese of Boston issued a statement in the archdiocese s official newspaper stating that the media s investigative reporting on the abuse crisis instigated a call for the Church to take responsibility for its failings and to reform itself to deal with what was shameful and hidden 55 O Malley had not seen the movie at that time but planned to do so 56 On November 9 2015 a review in the Catholic News Service called the film a generally accurate chronicle of the Boston scandal but objected to some of the portrayals and the film s view of the Church 57 On the Catholic News Service auxiliary bishop of Los Angeles Robert Barron said that it is not a bad movie as it shows how the wider community shares the responsibility for sexual abuse committed by priests but that the film is wrong to insinuate that the Church has not reformed 58 Vatican Radio the official radio service of the Holy See called it honest and compelling and said it helped the U S Catholic Church to accept fully the sin to admit it publicly and to pay all the consequences 59 Luca Pellegrini on the Vatican Radio website wrote that the Globe reporters made themselves examples of their most pure vocation that of finding the facts verifying sources and making themselves for the good of the community and of a city paladins of the need for justice 59 60 In February 2016 a Vatican City commission on clerical sex abuse attended a private screening of the film 61 Following the film s Best Picture win at the Oscars Vatican newspaper L Osservatore Romano ran a column assuring that it is not an anti Catholic film and Vatican Radio revealed that clerics in Rome have been recommending the film to each other 62 63 64 Criticism edit A January 7 2016 article in The New York Times cited author David F Pierre Jr who said that Spotlight is a misrepresentation of how the Church dealt with sexual abuse cases asserting that the movie s biggest flaw was its failure to portray psychologists who had assured Church officials that abusive priests could be safely returned to ministry after undergoing therapy treatments Open Road Films rebutted the detractor saying he was perpetuating a myth in order to distract from real stories of abuse 65 The film was attacked by Jack Dunn played by Gary Galone the public relations head and a member of the board at Boston College High School for portraying him as callous and indifferent to the scandal Dunn says he was immediately aware of the issues involved and worked to respond after viewing the film 66 Two of the Globe reporters depicted in the film Walter Robinson and Sacha Pfeiffer issued a statement in response to Dunn firmly standing by their recollections of the day that Dunn did his best to frame a story in the most favorable way possible for the institution he is representing That s what Jack did that day They said Dunn mounted a spirited public relations defense of Boston College High School during our first sit down interview at the school in early 2002 the scene in which Dunn is depicted 67 On March 15 2016 Open Road Films released a statement on how Dunn was portrayed in the film As is the case with most movies based on historical events Spotlight contains fictionalized dialogue that was attributed to Mr Dunn for dramatic effect We acknowledge that Mr Dunn was not part of the Archdiocesan cover up It is clear from his efforts on behalf of the victims at BC High that he and the filmmakers share a deep mutual concern for victims of abuse 68 Dunn then also released a statement I feel vindicated by the public statement and relieved to have the record set straight on an issue that has caused me and my family tremendous pain While it will never erase the horrific experience of being falsely portrayed in an Academy Award winning film this public statement enables me to move forward with my reputation and integrity intact 68 Accolades edit Main article List of accolades received by Spotlight Spotlight has been critically acclaimed and has been included in many critics Top Ten Films of 2015 lists 69 The film has received over 100 industry and critics awards and nominations The American Film Institute selected Spotlight as one of the Top Ten Films of the year 70 The film garnered three Golden Globe

adjusted for ticket price inflation to win Best Picture within the past four decades after The Hurt Locker with 17 million 78 Spotlight was listed on over 120 critics and publications top ten lists 69 It was also voted the 88th greatest film since 2000 in an international critics poll conducted by BBC 79 In 2018 IndieWire writers ranked its screenplay the 12th best American screenplay of the 21st

member of her family her parents Frank and Jackie and older brother Leo are all deaf She assists with the family fishing business and plans to join it full time after high school One day at school Ruby sees her crush Miles signing up for choir as his elective so she signs up too The music teacher Mr Bernardo Mr V Villalobos encourages Ruby to sing more and assigns her to a duet with Miles Meanwhile Frank and Leo struggle to make ends meet with the fishing business as new fees and sanctions are imposed by the local board At a board meeting everyone is angry about the fact that more boats are disappearing from the harbor During the yelling Frank announces that he is going to start his own company to get around the new restrictions and intends to sell his fish on his own inviting other local fishermen to join him The family struggles to get the new business off the ground relying on Ruby to spread the word Mr V encourages Ruby to audition for Berklee College of Music his alma mater and offers her private lessons to prepare Ruby agrees but her increasing commitments to the family business her parents are dependent upon her to interpret for them cause her to be late to their lessons Mr V grows irritated with Ruby s constant tardiness and chastises her for wasting his time and not caring enough about music While fishing one day when Ruby is off swimming with Miles Frank and Leo sail with a federal fishing observer on board who does not know in advance that they are deaf The boat is intercepted by the Coast Guard after failing to respond to ship horns and radio calls Frank and Leo are fined and have their fishing licenses suspended for negligence When they tell Ruby that she should have been on the boat with them she tells them she can t always interpret for them and she was not at fault Frank and Leo appeal and get their license back on the condition that they have a hearing person on board at all times Ruby announces to the family that she is forgoing college and will join the business full time Her parents are supportive but Leo reacts angrily insisting that they can manage without Ruby as she truly has talent He and Ruby later have an argument where he tells her that she will regret not going to college forever Ruby s family attends her choir recital and notice the positive reception from the surrounding audience That night Frank asks Ruby to sing for him while he feels her vocal cords growing emotional The family then drives to Boston with Ruby for her Berklee audition Before her audition she sees Miles who reveals that he failed at his audition and wishes her luck Ruby s family sneaks up to the balcony while Mr V comes to accompany her on piano Ruby is nervous and unprepared at first but after Mr V deliberately makes a mistake on his accompaniment she s allowed to start again and gains confidence when she sees her family She signs along while singing Both Sides Now by Joni Mitchell so they can understand what she is singing Ruby is accepted to Berklee and invites Miles to visit her in Boston Meanwhile the hearing workers in the family s fishing business have been learning sign language enabling them to communicate with and interpret for the family Ruby s friend Gertie drives her to Boston for college as her family sees them off Ruby signs I love you so much literal translation I really love you to them as they drive away Cast edit Emilia Jones as Ruby Rossi Eugenio Derbez as Bernardo Mr V Villalobos the high school choir director Troy Kotsur as Frank Rossi Ruby s father Ferdia Walsh Peelo as Miles Ruby s love interest Marlee Matlin as Jackie Rossi Ruby s mother Daniel Durant as Leo Rossi Ruby s brother Amy Forsyth as Gertie Ruby s best friend Kevin Chapman as Brady John Fiore as Tony Salgado 6 7 Rebecca Gibel as Joanne Biles 8 9 Production edit Development and writing edit Sian Heder the film s writer and director CODA written and directed by Sian Heder is an English language remake of the French language film La Famille Bélier which was released in 2014 and was successful at the French box office Philippe Rousselet was one of the original film s producers and he had the right to do a remake 10 He and producer Patrick Wachsberger approached Heder to direct a remake for a United States audience 11 Heder said They were interested in adapting the film but they wanted someone to make it unique and take the premise from the original and also reinvent it 10 By May 2019 the companies Pathé Films and Vendôme Group had formed a film production partnership to develop and produce English language films with the first being CODA 12 CODA is set in Gloucester Massachusetts While its predecessor La Famille Bélier was set on a rural dairy farm in France Heder chose to set CODA in Gloucester being familiar with the city from visiting the North Shore in the summer when growing up Heder explained For me it has the combination of being very picturesque and quintessentially New England but also with a working class grit to it 10 Heder learned American Sign Language in the process of writing the script with 40 of it ultimately being in ASL 10 The director was helped by two deaf collaborators whom she called ASL masters Alexandria Wailes and Anne Tomasetti 11 To prepare for the film Heder observed a fish processing plant and consulted the local harbormaster about how authorities would raid a boat She received feedback from director Kenneth Lonergan who directed the 2016 film Manchester by the Sea which was set in Manchester by the Sea Massachusetts 13 and members of the fishing industry nonprofit Gloucester Fishermen s Wives Association Several consultants and a fisherman educated Heder in local fishing practices 13 Casting edit Marlee Matlin left was the first person to be cast while Daniel Durant right made his feature film acting debut in this film Marlee Matlin an award winning and internationally known actress was the first person cast for the film During the development process the film s financiers resisted casting deaf actors for the remaining deaf characters but Matlin threatened to drop out unless deaf actors were cast and the financiers ultimately relented 14 Heder described the casting as an opportunity for Matlin to play against type her previous roles have been put together and classy characters Heder said Marlee in real life is much more funny and she has a dirty sense of humor This role was a working class fisherman s wife and she has a lot of elements of her personality that were very right for this character Matlin used her connections with Deaf West Theatre in Los Angeles California to help Heder find additional deaf actors Heder saw Troy Kotsur in a Deaf West production and cast him as the fisherman and father She cast Daniel Durant after finding him through auditions Matlin Kotsur and Durant were already familiar with one another through their collaboration on the Deaf West production of the musical Spring Awakening 10 Matlin described her interest in getting CODA made I felt that audiences would really see deaf people in a film There are so many levels for people to identify with and for people with no connection who have never met a deaf person to see sign language to see deaf people in normal day to day settings People think that deaf people are monolithic in how they approach life And this film bursts that myth But to burst that myth it had to be told as authentically as possible And it s strange because studios clearly have the ability to greenlight a film and cast whomever they want and there continues to be a lack of awareness that you can tell universal stories with deaf characters 14 Kotsur said You have to think a little bit outside the box and present more opportunities instead of just having two options You know you write this script because somebody s deaf or I m writing it because it s a character that happens to be deaf There s a distinction there 11 Heder hired a rotating group of ASL interpreters that facilitated communication with signing and speaking among the cast and crew 10 She connected with the deaf community in nearby Boston to secure the interpreters for on set communication 13 Matlin said Heder really immersed herself into our culture and made every attempt to learn and to work with us and having two directors of sign language on the set plus interpreters plus the crew who learned our language everyone working together it was working like on any other set but the sign language aspect made it extra special 15 The director also auditioned hundreds of teenage girls before casting Emilia Jones as the hearing member of the deaf family Jones took voice lessons and learned ASL for nine months before filming started Heder also chose to cast Eugenio Derbez as the girl s choirmaster seeing him as a fit for her amalgamation of Heder s college rhythm teacher and her high school drama and English teachers 10 Filming edit The film was shot on location in Gloucester Massachusetts in the middle of 2019 13 In the film the family lives in what WBUR s The ARTery described as a creaky clapboard cottage with a yard jammed with boats traps and nets During location scouting Heder came across what she found to be the ideal house for the family home and received permission from its residents to use it as a filming location The choirmaster s home was a Victorian style house on the sea where Heder had visited family friends multiple times in her childhood and they allowed her to film there 13 A fisherman who educated Heder in local fishing practices allowed his fishing trawler to be used as a film set Scenes set in a flooded quarry were filmed at the Steel Derrick quarry in Rockport Massachusetts 13 Music edit Main article CODA soundtrack Marius de Vries composed the film s soundtrack and compiled and co produced the album with Nicholai Baxter featuring the original score and incorporated songs 16 Speaking on creating music for the film which had predominantly deaf characters playing the leading roles he called it his biggest challenge and added that the music should be strong to connect with the emotions 17 Most of the incorporated songs in the film were recorded live and sung by the lead actors Emilia Jones and Ferdia Walsh Peelo accompanied by the CODA choir who were students at Berklee College of Music and Gloucester High School 18 19 The soundtrack also featured an original song sung by Jones Beyond the Shore which is played during the end credits of the film 20 The soundtrack album was released by Republic Records on August 13 2021 coinciding with the film s release 21 Release edit Screening edit CODA had its world premiere on January 28 2021 at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival as one of the opening day films 22 It screened as part of the festival s US Dramatic Competition 23 Due to the COVID 19 pandemic in the United States at the time CODA was screened virtually 13 The film received immediate rave reviews according to Agence France Presse which highlighted the positive comments from Variety and Deadline Hollywood 24 IndieWire wrote Heder has reportedly crafted a crowd pleasing tearjerker whose commercial promise will easily spark a bidding war between theatrical distributors and deep pocketed streamers 25 USA Today summarized the reception Propelled by its powerful inclusivity of the deaf community it s a refreshing reboot of the traditional teen romance and coming of age story 15 Two days after CODA s premiere Apple acquired distribution rights to the film for a festival record 25 million 26 At Sundance CODA won the U S Grand Jury Prize U S Dramatic Audience Award and a Special Jury Ensemble Cast Award The film s director Sian Heder won Best Director in the U S Dramatic section 27 In March 2022 CODA was screened at the Family Theater of the White House 28 29 Streaming edit The film was released through the streaming service Apple TV in selected countries on August 13 2021 30 IndieWire estimated the film grossed around 100 000 in its domestic opening weekend 31 Apple spent about 10 million on the film s award campaign 32 By March 20 2022 the film had been streamed in 973 000 households in the United States including 375 000 since the Oscar nomination announcements on February 8 33 In the three days following its Best Picture win the film saw a 300 increase in views from the previous week and was the most streamed program on Apple TV 34 According to Kotsur the film was initially rated R for language as displayed in the subtitles during the deaf characters dialogue in some scenes but after several back and forths and fights with the MPA it was ultimately reduced to PG 13 for strong sexual content and language and drug use months before its official release Kotsur added vulgar sign language is just a part of our culture But are you hearing people ready That s why it was so cool It s fascinating to see that in the script 35 CODA is the only modern day film to have won the Academy Award for Best Picture and not be released on home video formats Reception edit Critical response edit Emilia Jones received praise for her performance Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 94 of 295 reviews of the film were positive with an average rating of 7 8 10 The site s critics consensus reads CODA s story offers few surprises but strong representation and a terrific cast led by Emilia Jones brilliant performance bring this coming of age story vividly to life 36 Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 based on 46 critics indicating generally favorable reviews 37 Benjamin Lee s Guardian based three star review offered this summary Coda is a mostly likable concoction but one that s just too formulaic and ultimately rather calculated to secure the emotional response it so desperately wants by the big finale 38 Writing for The New York Times editor Jeannette Catsoulis wrote An openhearted embrace of deaf culture elevates this otherwise conventional tale of a talented teenager caught between ambition and loyalty 39 Variety s Owen Gilberman stated that Sian Heder had got the gift the holy essence of how to shape and craft a drama that spins and burbles and flows 40 His feeling was that the film brings this all off with such sincerity and precision and is so enthrallingly well acted that you may come away feeling grateful that this kind of mainstream dramatic craftsmanship still exists and also praised Jones and Kotsur s performances 40 The Hollywood Reporter s Jon Frosch opined that CODA faithfully works its way through a checklist of tropes from high school comedies disability dramas musical prodigy and inspiring teacher narratives coming of age tales about young people struggling to declare independence from overbearing families and indie chronicles of blue collar America 41 Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post called it an an old fashioned movie that adheres to admittedly familiar principles of storytelling and emotional stakes but by way of such a winning cast evocative atmosphere and genuine tone that its impossible not to love 42 RogerEbert com based critic Tomris Laffly wrote It s not that Heder doesn t embrace the aforesaid conventions for all their comforting worth she does But by twisting the formula and placing this recognizable story inside a new perhaps even groundbreaking setting with such loving acutely observed specificity she pulls off nothing short of a heartwarming miracle with her film 43 Brian Lowry of CNN described it as small movie that hits all the right notes 44 In contrast Tim Robey writing for The Telegraph criticized it as dramedy that could have taken more risks and added Heder s script makes every easy and rigged choice available reducing far too many of the family dynamics to the level of a bickering sitcom Comparing it with the Darius Marder directed Sound of Metal 2020 which he called a genuinely adventurous formally experimental take on deaf issues he wrote that CODA feels too cute by half 45 Response from the deaf community edit Deaf viewers had varied reactions to the film They praised the casting and performances of deaf actors and found the depiction of deaf characters as self sufficient and sexually active people to be in welcome contrast to previous depictions on screen Delbert Whetter vice chair of nonprofit RespectAbility said After seeing so many stories where people with disabilities are depicted as helpless forlorn souls needing to be rescued it is so refreshing to see a story with deaf characters that are small business owners and leaders in their fishing community with depth and nuance that rival and even exceed that of their hearing counterparts in the story Deaf writer Sara Nović also said I liked that these characters were sexual beings deaf and disabled people are often neutered or virginal in movies and books and that s extremely boring and inaccurate 46 Jenna Beacom a sensitivity reader and young adult author found much of the film misrepresented especially deaf people s competence and ability to thrive in 2021 and said that while thrilled that the movie exists in the sense of contributing to more deaf representation and hopefully more opportunities for even better representation she was very disturbed by how negatively the movie portrays the deaf and CODA experiences 46 A deaf parent of a singer herself Beacom found the film s assumption that being deaf means that you can t enjoy music or understand anyone else s enjoyment to be unfounded 47 Nović also said I actually think the story of a first gen college student just without the music she could have been studying anything is more compelling anyway I don t think that we needed the music part for this to be an interesting story 48 Other viewers also criticized the portrayal of deaf characters inability to appreciate music as a trope common in films featuring deaf characters such as Mr Holland s Opus Beyond Silence and Sound of Metal 49 50 Lennard Davis a CODA and disability scholar wrote this genre of films is glued to a different reality it is as if birds were obsessed with making movies in which humans were miserable about their inability to fly 50 The film s depiction of the hearing child interpreting for her parents even in settings where professional interpreters would be required by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 such as a court hearing and medical appointments received widespread criticism as being misrepresentative 46 51 52 Legacy edit In 2023 Screen Rant ranked it number 5 on its list of The 10 Best Movies of the 2020s So Far writing that Every so often there is a small indie movie that comes out of nowhere and surprises everyone CODA is the most recent example of such a sleeper hit and one of the most crowd pleasing movies of the 2020s this small family drama that was filled with light hearted moments won over so many people and left plenty of tears in their eyes 53 It also ranked number 18 on Collider s list of The 20 Best Drama Movies of the 2020s So Far calling it one of the definitive crowd pleasers of the decade 4 MovieWeb ranked it number 15 on its list of the 20 Most Underrated Films of the Last 5 Years writing that it certainly deserves way more credit and called it groundbreaking in its representation of disability 54 Accolades edit Troy Kotsur s performance received critical acclaim winning him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor making him the first male deaf actor to do so Main article List of accolades received by CODA 2021 film At the 94th Academy Awards the film won all three awards that it was nominated for Best Picture Best Supporting Actor

by a Cast in a Motion Picture 58 At the 33rd Producers Guild of America Awards the film was also awarded the Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture 59 CODA was one of 28 films that received the ReFrame Stamp for 2021 awarded by the gender equity coalition ReFrame for films that are proven to have gender balanced hiring 60 The film was also given the Seal of Authentic Representation from the Ruderman Family Foundation for Matlin s and Durant s roles as Ruby s mother and brother The seal is given to films and series that feature actors with disabilities who have at least five lines of dialogue 61 Planned stage musical adaptation edit On March 23 2022 it was reported by The New York Times that in an effort to keep the film relevant after awards season its producers plan to team up with Deaf West Theatre to develop a stage musical adaptation of the film with a creative team and production scheduled yet to be announced DJ Kurs Deaf West s artistic director expressed excitement for the project As a Deaf person I knew from the start that CODA would make a perfect musical It addresses our relationship with music and how we move through the world of sound like immigrants in a foreign country learning new seemingly arbitrary rules on the fly Like Deaf West s production of Spring Awakening the musical will incorporate both signing in American Sign Language and live singing 62 The report also noted that Rousselet had been asked in 2014 about making a stage version of La Famille Bélier but that he and the producers wanted to prioritize making CODA and forging a relationship with Deaf West first Rousselet further remarked It s going to be a new adventure for us But I think it has everything the characters the music the wonderful environment to make a beautiful musical Kotsur said that he hopes the musical will have its initial staging within two years he seemed to suggest that he might reprise his role as Frank in the production 62 Kurs noted his desire to have Matlin and Durant also reprise their roles as Jackie and Leo respectively along with Kotsur 63 See also edit Khamoshi The Musical Indian film released in August 1996 with similar story 64 Beyond Silence German film released in December 1996 with similar plot Children of a Lesser God released in October 1986 also stars Marlee Matlin in her Oscar winning

Queenan followed lying to the other officers that Queenan may be the spy Sullivan also calls in Costello s gang to the meeting location When Costello s men arrive Queenan helps Costigan escape before

Costello s henchmen who was wounded in the gunfight tells Costigan that he knows he is the rat before he succumbs to his wounds Sullivan looks through Queenan s belongings and learns that Costello is an FBI informant after reading Queenan s notebook A news report reveals that Delahunt was an undercover officer for the Boston Police Department but Costello suspects the police department made up the claim so he would stop looking for the mole Deciding to turn on him Sullivan directs the MSP to tail Costello and a gunfight erupts killing most of Costello s crew Sullivan confronts a wounded Costello who admits to being an FBI informant They exchange gunfire and Sullivan kills him His assignment finished Costigan goes to Sullivan to reveal his undercover status still unaware of the other

Sullivan returns to find Costigan gone and realizes that he now knows his true identity He deletes Costigan s records from police computers Costigan visits Madolyn who has revealed that she s pregnant

Costigan Inside is a CD of Costello s recorded conversations with Sullivan Scared that Costigan has revealed their affair she listens to the taped conversations and leaves Sullivan Costigan arranges to meet Sullivan on the rooftop of the building where Queenan was killed then arrests him Costigan calls Trooper Brown an acquaintance from the police academy but Brown pulls a gun on Costigan when he arrives unsure who is telling the truth Costigan says that he has evidence tying Sullivan to Costello and Brown lets him go down the elevator Upon reaching the lobby Costigan and Brown are killed by Trooper Barrigan a friend of Sullivan s who reveals himself to be another spy working for Costello Sullivan shoots Barrigan dead allowing him to out Barrigan as the mole while removing suspicion from himself At Costigan s funeral Sullivan and Madolyn stand by his grave As Madolyn silently cries Sullivan realizes that they were involved He attempts to talk to her but she ignores him At a later time

director of the film in 2010 In January 2003 Warner Bros producer Brad Grey and actor producer Brad Pitt bought the rights to remake the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs 2002 from Media Asia for 1 75 million 12 13 William Monahan was secured as a screenwriter and later Martin Scorsese who admired Monahan s script came on board as director 13 7 14 In March 2004 United Press International announced that Scorsese would be remaking Infernal Affairs and setting it in Boston and that Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt were slated to star 15 Pitt tentatively scheduled to play Sullivan later declined to play the role saying a younger actor should play the part he decided to produce the film instead 14 Scorsese s associate Kenneth Lonergan suggested Matt Damon who grew up in Boston for the part of Sullivan and Scorsese asked Jack Nicholson to play Costello 7 Robert De Niro was approached to play Queenan but De Niro declined in order to direct The Good Shepherd instead 16 Scorsese would later say that De Niro turned down the role as he was not interested 17 Ray Liotta was approached for a role in the film but declined due to a commitment to another project 18 Nicholson wanted the film to have something a little more than the usual gangster film and screenwriter Monahan came up with the idea of basing the Costello character on Irish American gangster Whitey Bulger This gave the screenplay an element of realism and an element of dangerous uncertainty because of the wide ranging carte blanche the FBI gave Bulger in exchange for revealing information about fellow gangsters 7 A technical consultant on the film was Tom Duffy who had served three decades on the Boston Police Department particularly as an undercover detective investigating the Irish mob 19 20 The Departed was officially greenlit by Warner Bros in early 2005 and began shooting in the spring of 2005 13 Some of the film was shot on location in Boston For budgetary and logistical reasons many scenes in particular interiors were shot in locations and sets in New York City which had tax incentives for filmmakers that Boston at the time did not 7 21 Themes and motifs edit Film critic Stanley Kauffmann said that for The Departed Scorsese was apparently concerned with the idea of identity one of the ancient themes of drama and how it affects one s actions emotions self knowledge even dreams Kauffmann however did not find the theme conveyed with particular effectiveness in the film 22 Film critic Roger Ebert compared Costigan and Sullivan s seeking of approval from those they are deceiving to Stockholm syndrome 23 Ebert also noted the themes of Catholic guilt 23 In the final scene a rat is seen on Sullivan s window ledge Scorsese acknowledges that while it is not meant to be taken literally it somewhat symbolizes the quest for the rat in the film and the strong sense of distrust among the characters much like post 9 11 U S The window view behind the rat is a nod to gangster films like Little Caesar 1931 Scarface 1932 and White Heat 1949 24 The film s penultimate scene at Costigan s funeral when Madolyn walks straight past Sullivan and out of camera without looking at him is a visual quotation of the famous closing scene from The Third Man Throughout the film Scorsese uses an X motif to foreshadow death in a manner similar to Howard Hawks film Scarface 1932 Examples include shots of cross beam supports in an airport walkway when Costigan is phoning Sgt Dignam the lighted X on the wall in Sullivan s office when he assures Costello over the phone that Costigan is not the rat the taped windows of the building Queenan enters before being thrown to his death behind Costigan s head in the elevator before he is shot and the carpeted hallway floor when Sullivan returns to his apartment before being shot by Dignam at the film s end 25 Reception edit Box office edit The Departed grossed 132 4 million in the United States and Canada and 159 million in other territories for a total gross of 291 5 million against a production budget of 90 million 1 The film grossed 26 9 million in its opening weekend becoming the fourth Scorsese film to debut at number one 26 In the following three weeks the film grossed 19 million 13 5 million and 9 8 million finishing second at the box office each time before grossing 7 7 million and dropping to 5th in its fifth week 27 Critical response edit As per the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes 91 of critics have given the film a positive review based on 287 reviews with an average rating of 8 30 out of 10 The site s critics consensus reads Featuring outstanding work from an excellent cast The Departed is a thoroughly engrossing gangster drama with the gritty authenticity and soupy morality we have come to expect from Martin Scorsese 28 On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 85 out of 100 with 92 positive reviews based on 39 critics indicating universal acclaim 29 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale 30 Entertainment Weekly ranked it on its end of the decade Best of list saying If they re lucky directors make one classic film in their career Martin Scorsese has one per decade Taxi Driver in the 70s Raging Bull in the 80s Goodfellas in the 90s His 2006 Irish Mafia masterpiece kept the streak alive 31 Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four praising Scorsese for thematically differentiating his film from the original 23 Online critic James Berardinelli awarded the film four stars out of four praising it as an American epic tragedy He went on to claim that the film deserves to be ranked alongside Scorsese s past successes including Taxi Driver Raging Bull and Goodfellas 32 Andrew Lau the co director of Infernal Affairs who was interviewed by Hong Kong newspaper Apple Daily said Of course I think the version I made is better but the Hollywood version is pretty good too Scorsese made the Hollywood version more attuned to American culture 33 Andy Lau one of the main actors in Infernal Affairs when asked how the movie compares to the original said The Departed was too long and it felt as if Hollywood had combined all three Infernal Affairs movies together 34 Although Lau said the script of the remake had some golden quotes he also felt it had a bit too much profanity He ultimately rated The Departed eight out of ten and said that the Hollywood remake is worth a view though according to Lau s spokeswoman Alice Tam he felt that the combination of the two female characters into one in The Departed was not as good as the original storyline 35 A few critics were disappointed in the film including J Hoberman of the Village Voice who wrote Infernal Affairs was surprisingly cool and effectively restrained for HK action but Scorsese raises the temperature with every ultraviolent interaction The surplus of belligerence and slur reach near Tarantinian levels appropriate as he s staking a claim to QT s turf 36 Top ten lists edit The film appeared on many critics top ten lists of the best films of 2006 37 Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer Joe Morgenstern of The Wall

when an Iraqi insurgent uses a cell phone to detonate the charge Squadmate Specialist Owen Eldridge feels guilty for failing to kill the man with the phone Staff Sergeant William James replaces Staff Sergeant Thompson He is often at odds with Sergeant J T Sanborn because he prefers to defuse devices by hand and does not communicate his plans He blocks Sanborn s view with smoke grenades as he approaches an IED and defuses it only moments before an Iraqi insurgent attempts to detonate it with a 9 volt battery In another incident James insists on disarming a complex car bomb despite Sanborn s protests that it is taking too long James responds by taking off his headset and flipping off Sanborn Sanborn is so worried by his conduct that he openly suggests fragging James to Eldridge while they are exploding unused ordnance outside of base On their return to base they encounter five armed men in Iraqi garb by an SUV which has a flat tire After a tense encounter James learns they are friendly British private military contractors While fixing the tire they come under sniper fire Three of the contractors are killed before James and Sanborn take over counter sniping killing three

Suhail Dabbach as a man forced to wear a bomb vest Production edit The small budget film was independently produced and directed by Kathryn Bigelow The screenplay was written by Mark Boal a freelance writer who was embedded as a journalist in 2004 with a U S Army EOD team in Iraq The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival in Italy during 2008 After being shown at the Toronto International Film Festival it was picked up for distribution in the United States by Summit Entertainment In May 2009 it was the Closing Night selection for Maryland Film Festival The film was released in the United States on June 26 2009 but received a more widespread theatrical release on July 24 2009 The film was nominated for nine Oscars at the 82nd Academy Awards in 2010 although the film had not yet recovered its budget by the time of the ceremony 7 It won six Oscars including Best Picture Best Director for Bigelow the first woman to win this award and Best Original Screenplay for Boal Writing edit The Hurt Locker is based on accounts of Mark Boal a freelance journalist who was embedded with an American bomb squad in the war in Iraq for two weeks in 2004 8 Director Bigelow was familiar with Boal s work before his experiences having adapted one of his Playboy articles as the short lived television series The Inside in 2002 When Boal was embedded with the squad he accompanied its members 10 to 15 times a day to watch their tasks and kept in touch with Bigelow via email about his experiences 9 Boal used his experiences as the basis of a fictional drama based on real events He said of the film s goal The idea is that it s the first movie about the Iraq War that purports to show the experience of the soldiers We wanted to show the kinds of things that soldiers go through that you can t see on CNN and I don t mean that in a censorship conspiracy way I just mean the news doesn t actually put photographers in with units that are this elite 10 Bigelow was fascinated with exploring the psychology behind the type of soldier who volunteers for this particular conflict and then because of their aptitude is chosen and given the opportunity to go into bomb disarmament and goes toward what everybody else is running from 11 While working with Boal in 2005 on the script originally titled The Something Jacket Bigelow began to do some preliminary rough storyboards to get an idea of the specific location needed Bomb disarmament protocol requires a containment area She wanted to make the film as authentic as possible and put the audience into the Humvee into a boots on the ground experience 11 Casting edit Jeremy RennerAnthony MackieBrian Geraghty For the main characters Bigelow made a point of casting relatively unknown actors it underscored the tension because with the lack of familiarity also comes a sense of unpredictability 11 Renner s character Staff Sergeant William James is a composite character with qualities based on individuals whom screenwriter Boal knew when embedded with the bomb squad 9 Bigelow cast Renner based on his work in Dahmer a film about Jeffrey Dahmer the notorious serial killer whose victims were boys 12 To prepare for the film Renner spent a week living and training at Fort Irwin a U S military reservation in the Mojave Desert in California He was taught to use C4 explosives learned how to render safe improvised explosive devices and how to wear a bomb suit 12 Mackie plays Sergeant J T Sanborn Describing the experience of filming in Jordan in the summer he said It was so desperately hot and we were so easily agitated But that movie was like doing a play We really looked out for each other and it was a great experience It made me believe in film 13 Several hundred thousand Iraqi refugees live in Jordan Bigelow cast refugees who had theatrical backgrounds such as Suhail Dabbach who plays the innocent man used as a suicide bomber at the film s end 9 Filming edit The film was shot in Jordan within miles of the Iraqi border to achieve Bigelow s goal of authenticity Iraqi refugees were used for extras and the cast worked in the intense heat of the Middle East The filmmakers had scouted for locations in Morocco but Bigelow felt its cities did not resemble Baghdad In addition she wanted to get as close to the war zone as possible Some of the locations were less than three miles from the Iraqi border 14 Bigelow had wanted to film in Iraq but the production security team could not guarantee their safety from snipers 11 Principal photography began in July 2007 in Jordan and Kuwait Temperatures averaged 120 F 49 C over the 44 days of shooting 10 11 12 Often four or more camera crews filmed simultaneously which resulted in nearly 200 hours of footage 14 15 The producer Greg Shapiro spoke about security concerns of filming in Jordan It was interesting telling people we were going to make the movie in Jordan because the first question everybody asked was about the security situation here Bigelow s choice to film in Jordan met some resistance In discussion she found that her cast and crew shared stereotypes of the region from American culture Sadly people in America and Los Angeles have these perceptions she said But once you get off the plane you realize it s like Manhattan without the trees she continued As Iraq dominated discourse in America and around the world Bigelow believed that filmmakers would continue to explore the conflict making Jordan the natural place to film 16 According to producer Tony Mark the blood sweat and heat captured on camera in the production was mirrored behind the scenes It s a tough tough movie about a tough tough subject Mark said in an interview There was a palpable tension throughout on the set It was just like the onscreen story of three guys who fight with each other but when the time comes to do the work they come together to get the job done 17 Renner remembered I got food bugs Then I got food poisoning lost 15 lbs in three days 12 In addition to the burden of the heat the bomb suit he had to wear all day weighed 80 100 lb 36 45 kg 18 In a scene in which his character carries a dead Iraqi boy Renner fell down some stairs and twisted his ankle which delayed filming because he could not walk At that point people wanted to quit All the departments were struggling to get their job done none of them were communicating 12 A week later filming resumed 12 Tony Mark recalled the armorer David Fencl s finishing a 12 hour day He found he had to stay up all night to make proper ammunition for a sniper rifle as the supplies did not clear Jordanian customs in time for the scheduled shoot 17 Due to import restrictions on military props the film s special effects artist Richard Stutsman used Chinese fireworks for gunpowder One day he was assembling a prop and the heat and friction caused the fireworks to blow up in his face Two days later he returned to work 12 The film shoot had few of the normal Hollywood perks nobody on the set got an air conditioned trailer or a private bathroom 17 Renner said that great care was taken to ensure the film s authenticity 19 According to Renner shooting the film in the Middle East contributed to this There were two by fours with nails being dropped from two story buildings that hit me in the helmet and they were throwing rocks We got shot at a few times while we were filming Renner said When you see it you re gonna feel like you ve been in war 20 You can t fake that amount of heat Mackie says adding When you are on set and all of the extras are Iraqi refugees it really informs the movie that you re making When you start hearing the stories from a true perspective of people who were actually there it gives you a clear viewpoint of where you are as an artist and the story you would like to tell It was a great experience to be there 21 Cinematography edit For the film director Bigelow sought to immerse audiences into something that was raw immediate and visceral Impressed with cinematographer Barry Ackroyd s work on United 93 and The Wind That Shakes the Barley Bigelow invited him to work on her film While the film was independently produced and filmed on a low budget Bigelow used four Super 16 mm cameras to capture multiple perspectives saying That s how we experience reality by looking at the microcosm and the macrocosm simultaneously The eye sees differently than the lens but with multiple focal lengths and a muscular editorial style the lens can give you that microcosm macrocosm perspective and that contributes to the feeling of total immersion 22 In staging the film s action sequences Bigelow did not want to lose a sense of the geography and used multiple cameras to allow her to look at any particular set piece from every possible perspective 11 Editing edit The Hurt Locker was edited by Chris Innis and Bob Murawski 23 24 The two editors worked with almost 200 hours of footage from the multiple hand held cameras in use during the shoot 24 Adding to the challenge Boal s screenplay had a non traditional asymmetrical episodic structure There was no traditional villain and tension was derived from the characters internal conflicts and the suspense from the explosives and snipers 24 This movie is kind of like a horror film where you re unable to see the killer says Innis You know a bomb could go off at any minute but you never know just when it s going to happen so the ideas of Alfred Hitchcock about making your audience anxious were influential for us when we did the editing 25 The raw footage was described as a hodge podge of disconnected nausea inducing motion that was constantly crossing the 180 degree line 24 Innis spent the first eight weeks editing the film on location in Jordan before returning to Los Angeles where Murawski joined her The process took over eight months to complete 23 26 The goal was to edit a brutally realistic portrayal of the realities of war using minimal special effects or technical enhancement 23 24 Innis stated that they really wanted the film to retain that newsreel documentary quality Too many stage y effects would have been distracting The editing in this film was all about restraint 23 Editing on location led to additional complications in post production The production was unwilling to risk sending undeveloped film through high security airports where the cans could be opened X rayed or damaged Accordingly film was hand carried on a flight by a production assistant from Amman to London After the Super 16mm film was transferred to DVcam at a lab in London the video dailies were transported by plane back to the Middle East to be imported into the editing system The whole journey would take anywhere from three days to a week and was described by Innis as the modern day equivalent of shipping via donkey cart 24 The low production budget and the lack of a developed film infrastructure in the area hampered the process according to Innis We were working with grainy Super 16mm film editing in standard definition We tried doing FTP downloads but at the time the facilities in Jordan simply couldn t handle it 23 24 Producer Tony Mark later negotiated the use of a local radio station late at night to receive low grade QuickTime clips over the Internet so the crew would not be shooting blindly 24 Musical score and sound edit Main article The Hurt Locker soundtrack Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders composed the score Bigelow wanted Beltrami to score for the film as she liked his critically acclaimed work in 3 10 to Yuma 2007 Paul N J Ottosson worked on the film s sound design 27 The score was released in June 2009 through Lakeshore Records Release edit Festival screenings edit The Hurt Locker had its world premiere at the Venice International Film Festival on September 4 2008 and the film received a 10 minute standing ovation at the end of its screening 28 At the festival the film won the SIGNIS award 29 the Arca Cinemagiovani Award Arca Young Cinema Award for Best Film Venezia 65 chosen by an international youth jury the Human Rights Film Network Award and the Venezia Cinema Award known as the Navicella 30 The film also screened at the 33rd Annual Toronto International Film Festival on September 8 28 where it generated keen interest though distributors were reluctant to buy it since previous films about the Iraq War performed poorly at the box office 31 Summit Entertainment purchased the film for distribution in the United States in what was perceived as a skittish climate for pic sales 32 In the rest of 2008 The Hurt Locker screened at the 3rd Zurich Film Festival 33 the 37th Festival du Nouveau Cinéma the 21st Mar del Plata Film Festival 34 the 5th Dubai International Film Festival and the 12th Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival 35 In 2009 The Hurt Locker screened at the Göteborg International Film Festival 36 the 10th Film Comment Selects festival 37 and the South by Southwest film festival 38 It was the closing night film at Maryland Film Festival 2009 with Bigelow presenting It had a centerpiece screening at the 3rd AFI Dallas International Film Festival where director Kathryn Bigelow received the Dallas Star Award 39 Other 2009 festivals included the Human Rights Nights International Film Festival 40 the Seattle International Film Festival 41 and the Philadelphia Film Festival 42 Theatrical run edit The Hurt Locker was first publicly released in Italy by Warner Bros on October 10 2008 28 Summit Entertainment picked the film up for distribution in the United States for 1 5 million after it was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival 43 The Hurt Locker was released in the United States on June 26 2009 with a limited release at four theaters in Los Angeles and New York City 44 Over its first weekend the film grossed 145 352 averaging 36 338 per theater The following weekend beginning July 3 the film grossed 131 202 at nine theaters averaging 14 578 per theater 45 It held the highest per screen average of any film playing theatrically in the United States for the first two weeks of its release 1 gradually moving into the top 20 chart with much wider released bigger budget studio films 46 It held around number 13 or number 14 on box office charts for an additional four weeks Summit Entertainment took The Hurt Locker wider to more than 200 screens on July 24 2009 and more than 500 screens on July 31 2009 The film s final gross was 17 017 811 in the United States and Canada and 32 212 961 in other countries bringing its worldwide total to 49 230 772 It was a success against its budget of 15 million 1 According to the Los Angeles Times The Hurt Locker performed better than most recent dramas about Middle East conflict The film outperformed all other Iraq war themed films such as In the Valley of Elah 2007 Stop Loss 2008 and Afghanistan themed Lions for Lambs 2007 43 In the United States The Hurt Locker is one of only five Best Picture winners The English Patient Amadeus The Artist and The Shape of Water being the other four to never enter the weekend box office top 5 since top 10 rankings were first recorded in 1982 It is also one of the only two Best Picture winners on record never to have entered the weekend box office top 10 The Artist being the other The Hurt Locker opened in the top ten in the United Kingdom in 103 theaters scoring the fourth highest per screen average of 3 607 ranking between G Force and G I Joe in overall grosses The film garnered half a million dollars in its opening weekend in the United Kingdom of August 28 through August 30 2009 47 and grossed over a million dollars in the UK Japan Spain and France through March 48 Distribution Independent film print shortage edit According to an article in the Springfield Illinois State Journal Register as of August 2009 there was a shortage of film prints of The Hurt Locker as well as other hit independent films such as Food Inc 49 Distributors told theater owners that they would have to wait weeks or months past the initial U S release date to get the few available prints that were already in distribution Sometimes the distributors goof up said a film buyer for one theater They misjudge how wide they should go 49 One theory is that the independent films have a hard time competing for screen space during the summer against blockbuster tent pole films that take up as much as half the screens in any given city flooding the United States market with thousands of prints Theater owners have also complained about distributors bunching too many movies too close together 49 50 It is also thought that independent film distributors are trying to cut their losses on prints by recycling them Given the popularity of some of the films that are hard to come by this strategy may be leaving box office money on the table 49 50 Home media edit The Hurt Locker was released on DVD and Blu ray in North America on January 12 2010 This disc includes an added audio commentary featuring director Kathryn Bigelow writer Mark Boal and other members of the production crew an image gallery of photos from shooting and a 15 minute EPK featurette highlighting the filming experience in Jordan and the film s production The UK DVD and Blu ray have no commentary On February 22 2022 two years after getting a digital 4K release Lionsgate and Best Buy released a steelbook of the movie marking the first time it came to 4K resolution U S sales of the DVD topped 30 million by mid August 2010 51 Reception edit Critical response edit The Hurt Locker received widespread acclaim with Renner s performance receiving praise from critics Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 97 based on 290 reviews with a weighted average rating of 8 5 10 It was the second highest rated film of 2009 behind Pixar s Up The critics consensus reads A well acted intensely shot action filled war epic Kathryn Bigelow s The Hurt Locker is thus far the best of the recent dramatizations of the Iraq War 52 Metacritic which assigns a normalized score gave the film an average score of 95 out of 100 based on 37 critics indicating universal acclaim 53 Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun Times rated the film as the best of 2009 writing The Hurt Locker is a great film an intelligent film a film shot clearly so that we know exactly who everybody is and where they are and what they re doing and why He applauded how the suspense was built calling the film spellbinding Ebert considered Renner a leading contender for Academy Awards writing His performance is not built on complex speeches but on a visceral projection of who this man is and what he feels He is not a hero in a conventional sense 54 He eventually ranked it the second best film of the decade behind only Synecdoche New York 55 Richard Corliss of Time magazine also spoke highly of Renner s performance calling it a highlight of the film Corliss wrote He s ordinary pudgy faced quiet and at first seems to lack the screen charisma to carry a film That supposition vanishes in a few minutes as Renner slowly reveals the strength confidence and unpredictability of a young Russell Crowe The merging of actor and character is one of the big things to love about this movie It s a creepy marvel to watch James in action He has the cool aplomb analytical acumen and attention to detail of a great athlete or a master psychopath maybe both 56 Corliss praised the film s steely calm tone reflective of its main character Corliss summarized The Hurt Locker is a near perfect movie about men in war men at work Through sturdy imagery and violent action it says that even Hell needs heroes 56 A O Scott of The New York Times called The Hurt Locker the best American feature film yet made about the war in Iraq You may emerge from The Hurt Locker shaken exhilarated and drained but you will also be thinking The movie is a viscerally exciting adrenaline soaked tour de force of suspense and surprise full of explosions and hectic scenes of combat but it blows a hole in the condescending assumption that such effects are just empty spectacle or mindless noise 57 Scott noticed that the film reserved criticism of the war but wrote of how the director handled the film s limits Ms Bigelow practicing a kind of hyperbolic realism distills the psychological essence and moral complications of modern warfare into a series of brilliant agonizing set pieces He also applauded the convergence of the characters in the film saying that it focuses on three men whose contrasting temperaments knit this episodic exploration of peril and bravery into a coherent and satisfying story 57 Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the performances of Renner Mackie and Geraghty would raise their profiles considerably and said their characters reveal their unlooked for aspects such as Renner s character being playful with an Iraqi boy Turan applauded Boal s lean and compelling script and said of Bigelow s direction Bigelow and her team bring an awesome ferocity to re creating the unhinged mania of bomb removal in an alien culturally unfathomable atmosphere 58 Guy Westwell of Sight Sound wrote that the cinematographer Barry Ackroyd provided sharp handheld coverage and that Paul N J Ottosson s sound design uses the barely perceptible ringing of tinnitus to amp up the tension 59 Westwell praised the director s skill The careful mapping of the subtle differences between each bomb the play with point of view and the attenuation of key action sequences lends the film a distinctive quality that can only be attributed to Bigelow s clever confident direction 59 The critic noted the film s different take on the Iraq War writing that it confronts the fact that men often take great pleasure in war 59 He concluded This unapologetic celebration of a testosterone fuelled lust for war may gall Yet there is something original and distinctive about the film s willingness to admit that for some men and many moviegoers war carries an intrinsic dramatic charge 59 Amy Taubin of Film Comment described The Hurt Locker as a structuralist war movie and a totally immersive off the charts high anxiety experience from beginning to end Taubin praised Ackroyd s brilliant cinematography with multiple viewpoints She said of the film s editing Bob Murawski and Chris Innis s editing is similarly quick and nervous the rapid changes in POV as they cut from one camera s coverage to another s makes you feel as if you like the characters are under threat from all sides 60 Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal called it A first rate action thriller a vivid evocation of urban warfare in Iraq a penetrating study of heroism and a showcase for austere technique terse writing and a trio of brilliant performances 61 The Toronto Star critic Peter Howell said Just when you think the battle of Iraq war dramas has been fought and lost along comes one that demands to be seen If you can sit through The Hurt Locker without your heart nearly pounding through your chest you must be made of granite 62 Entertainment Weekly s film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the film the rare A rating calling it an intense action driven war pic a muscular efficient standout that simultaneously conveys the feeling of combat from within as well as what it looks like on the ground This ain t no war videogame 63 Derek Elley of Variety found The Hurt Locker to be gripping as a thriller but felt that the film was weakened by its fuzzy and hardly original psychology Elley wrote that it was unclear to know where the drama lay These guys get by on old fashioned guts and instinct rather than sissy hardware but it s not a pure men under stress drama either The critic also felt that the script showed signs of artificially straining for character depth 64 Anne Thompson also writing for Variety believed The Hurt Locker to be a contender for Best Picture particularly based on the unique subject matter pursued by a female director and on being an exception to other films about the Iraq War which had performed poorly 65 Tara McKelvey from The American Prospect wrote that the film is pro U S Army propaganda although it suggests it is anti war with the opening statement War is a drug She continues You feel empathy for the soldiers when they shoot And in this way the full impact of the Iraq war at least as it was fought in 2004 becomes clear American soldiers shot at Iraqi civilians even when for example they just happened to be holding a cell phone and standing near an IED She concludes For all the graphic violence bloody explosions and literally human butchery that is shown in the film The Hurt Locker is one of the most effective recruiting vehicles for the U S Army that I have seen 66 John Pilger journalist and documentarian criticized the film in the New Statesman writing that it offers a vicarious thrill via yet another standard issue psychopath high on violence in somebody else s country where the deaths of a million people are consigned to cinematic oblivion 67 In 2010 the Independent Film Television Alliance selected the film as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years 68 The Hurt Locker was named the tenth Best Film of the 21st Century So Far in 2017 by The New York Times chief film critics A O Scott and Manohla Dargis 69 Media Historian Prof Stuart Ewen criticised in the movie what he described as a complete celebration of a lone lunatic but who ultimately is the quintessential American Hero because lone lunatics are very big in this country 2 Response among veterans edit The film was criticized by some Iraq veterans and embedded reporters for inaccurately portraying wartime conditions 70 Writing for The Huffington Post Iraq veteran Kate Hoit said that The Hurt Locker is Hollywood s version of the Iraq war and of the soldiers who fight it and their version is inaccurate She described the film as being better than a lot of the recent war movies that have been released but expressed concerns that several errors among them wrong uniforms lack of radio communication or misbehavior of the soldiers would alienate service members from enjoying the film 71 Author Brandon Friedman also a combat veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan shared a similar view at VetVoice The Hurt Locker is a high tension well made action movie that will certainly keep most viewers on the edges of their seats But if you know anything about the Army or about operations or life in Iraq you ll be so distracted by the nonsensical sequences and plot twists that it will ruin the movie for you It certainly did for me Friedman criticized the inaccuracy of the film s representation of combat saying in real life EOD techs don t conduct dangerous missions as autonomous three man teams without communications gear Another thing you ll rarely hear in combat is an EOD E 7 suggesting to two or three of his guys that they leave the scene of an explosion in an Iraqi city by saying C mon let s split up We can cover more ground that way 72 At the blog Army of Dude infantryman and Iraq veteran Alex Horton noted that the way the team goes about their missions is completely absurd He still generally enjoyed it and called it the best Iraq movie to date 73 Troy Steward another combat veteran wrote on the blog Bouhammer that while the film accurately depicted the scale of bomb violence and the relations between Iraqis and troops just about everything else wasn t realistic Steward went on to say I was amazed that a movie so bad could get any kind of accolades from anyone 74 A review published March 8 2010 in the Air Force Times cited overall negative reviews from bomb experts in Iraq attached to the 4th Brigade 1st Armored Division quoting a bomb disposal team leader who called the film s portrayal of a bomb expert grossly exaggerated and not appropriate and describing the lead character as more of a run and gun cowboy type exactly the kind of person that we re not looking for 75 Another bomb disposal team member said that the lead character s swagger would put a whole team at risk Our team leaders don t have that kind of invincibility complex and if they do they aren t allowed to operate A team leader s first priority is getting his team home in one piece 75 On the embedded side former correspondent for The Politico and Military Times Christian Lowe who embedded with U S military units each year from 2002 to 2005 explained at DefenseTech Some of the scenes are so disconnected with reality to be almost parody 76 Former British bomb disposal officer Guy Marot said James makes us look like hot headed irrational adrenaline junkies with no self discipline It s immensely disrespectful to the many officers who have lost their lives 77 On the other hand Henry Engelhardt an adjutant with the National Explosive Ordnance Disposal Association having twenty years experience in bomb defusal complimented the film s atmosphere and depiction of the difficulties of the job saying Of course no film is realistic in all its details but the important things were done very well 78 Top ten lists

The Social Network and Drive My Car and also the second to win Best Picture after Schindler s List The five awards from the Boston Society of Film Critics were the most by that organization to a single film in the group s 30 year history 86 In February 2010 the film s producer Nicolas Chartier emailed a group of Academy Award voters in an attempt to sway them to vote for The Hurt Locker instead of a 500M film referring to Avatar for the Best Picture award He later issued a public apology saying that it was out of line and not in the spirit of the celebration of cinema that this acknowledgment is 87 The Academy banned him from attending the award ceremony the first time the academy has ever banned an individual nominee 88 Lawsuits edit Sarver lawsuit edit In early March 2010 U S Army bomb disposal expert Master Sergeant Jeffrey Sarver filed a multimillion dollar lawsuit against The Hurt Locker Sarver s lawsuit claimed he used the term hurt locker and the phrase war is a drug around Boal that his likeness was used to create the character William James and that the portrayal of James defames Sarver 89 Sarver said he felt just a little bit hurt a little bit felt left out and cheated out of financial participation in the film 90 Sarver claimed he originated the title of the film however according to the film s website the title is a decades old colloquialism for being injured as in they sent him to the hurt locker 91 It dates back to the Vietnam War where it was one of several phrases meaning in trouble or at a disadvantage in bad shape 92 Boal defended himself to the press saying the film is a work of fiction inspired by many people s stories 90 He said he talked to more than 100 soldiers during his research 93 Jody Simon a Los Angeles based entertainment lawyer noted that soldiers don t have privacy and that when the military embedded Boal they gave him full permission to use his observations as he saw fit Summit Entertainment the producers of the film said in early March that they hoped for a quick resolution to the suit 90 In the December 8 2011 issue of The Hollywood Reporter it was announced that the court threw out Sarver s lawsuit A federal judge ordered him to pay more than 180 000 in attorney fees 94 Copyright infringement lawsuit edit On May 12 2010 Voltage Pictures the production company behind The Hurt Locker announced that it would attempt to sue potentially tens of thousands of online computer users who downloaded unlicensed copies of the film using the BitTorrent and P2P networks It would be the largest lawsuit of its kind 95 96 On May 28 2010 it filed a complaint against 5 000 unidentified BitTorrent users in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia Voltage announced its intention to demand 1 500 from each defendant to release him or her from the suit 97 Several people however refused to settle with the studio 98 The US Copyright Group USCG has since dropped all cases against the alleged Hurt Locker downloaders 99 On August 29 2011 the Federal Court of Canada ordered three Canadian ISPs Bell Canada Cogeco and Vidéotron to disclose the names and addresses of the subscribers whose IP addresses were suspected of having downloaded a copy of the film The ISPs were given two weeks to comply with the order 100 References edit a b c d The Hurt Locker 2009 Box Office

Mumbai to find Latika and discover that Maman is raising her to be a prostitute The brothers rescue her Salim shooting Maman dead Salim gets a job with Javed a rival crime lord In their room Salim

the platform at the train station kiss and dance to the song Jai Ho along with all the other characters Cast edit Dev Patel as Jamal Malik a boy born and raised in the poverty of Bombay Mumbai 12

television ensemble drama Skins 13 14 Ayush Mahesh Khedekar as youngest Jamal Tanay Chheda as middle Jamal Freida Pinto as Latika a girl from the streets who joins Jamal and Salim then disappears

Choudhary as Jamal s and Salim s mother Mia Drake Inderbitzin as Adele an American tourist Siddhesh Patil as Arvind blind beggar Shruti Seth as Call Center Instructor Arfi Lamba as Bardi Anjum Sharma as one of the call center operators Production edit Danny Boyle directed the film Screenwriter Simon Beaufoy wrote Slumdog Millionaire based on the Boeke Prize winning and Commonwealth Writers Prize nominated novel Q A by Vikas Swarup 17 To hone the script Beaufoy made three research trips to India and interviewed street children finding himself impressed with their attitudes The screenwriter said of his goal for the script I wanted to get across the sense of this huge amount of fun laughter chat and sense of community that is in these slums What you pick up on is this mass of energy 18 By the summer of 2006 British production companies Celador Films and Film4 Productions invited director Danny Boyle to read the script of Slumdog Millionaire Boyle hesitated since he was not interested in making a film about Who Wants to Be a Millionaire which was produced by Celador 13 Then Boyle learned that the screenwriter was Beaufoy who had written The Full Monty 1997 one of the director s favourite British films and decided to revisit the script 19 Boyle was impressed by how Beaufoy wove the multiple storylines from Swarup s book into one narrative and the director decided to commit to the project The film was projected to cost 15 million so Celador sought a US film distributor to share costs Warner Independent Pictures gave 5 million and got the rights to the film 13 Gail Stevens came on board to oversee casting globally Stevens had worked with Boyle throughout his career and was well known for discovering new talent Meredith Tucker was appointed to cast out of the US The filmmakers then travelled to Mumbai in September 2007 with a partial crew and began hiring local cast and crew for production in Karjat Originally appointed as one of the five casting directors in India Loveleen Tandan has stated I suggested to Danny and Simon Beaufoy the writer of Slumdog that it was important to do some of it in Hindi to bring the film alive They asked me to pen the Hindi dialogues which I of course instantly agreed to do And as we drew closer to the shoot date Danny asked me to step in as the co director 20 Boyle then decided to translate nearly a third of the film s English dialogue into Hindi The director fibbed to Warner Independent s president that he wanted 10 of the dialogue in Hindi and she approved the change 21 Filming locations included shooting in Mumbai s megaslum and in shantytown parts of Juhu so film makers controlled the crowds by befriending onlookers 13 Filming began on 5 November 2007 14 In addition to Swarup s original novel Q A the film was also inspired by Indian cinema 22 Tandan has referred to Slumdog Millionaire as a homage to Hindi cinema noting that Simon Beaufoy studied Salim Javed s kind of cinema minutely 23 Boyle has cited the influence of several Bollywood films set in Mumbai i Deewaar 1975 which Boyle described as being absolutely key to Indian cinema is a crime film written by Salim Javed based on the Bombay gangster Haji Mastan portrayed by Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan whose autograph Jamal seeks at the beginning of Slumdog Millionaire 22 Anil Kapoor noted that some scenes of the film are like Deewaar the story of two brothers of whom one is completely after money while the younger one is honest and not interested in money 24 Slumdog Millionaire has a similar narrative structure to Deewaar 25 Satya 1998 written by Saurabh Shukla who plays Constable Srinivas in Slumdog Millionaire and Company 2002 based on the D Company both offered slick often mesmerising portrayals of the Mumbai underworld and displayed realistic brutality and urban violence Boyle has also stated that the chase in one of the opening scenes of Slumdog Millionaire was based on a 12 minute police chase through the crowded Dharavi slum in Black Friday 2007 adapted from Hussein Zaidi s book of the same name about the 1993 Bombay bombings 22 26 27 28 Boyle has cited other Indian films as influences in later interviews ii 29 The rags to riches underdog theme was also a recurring theme in classic Bollywood movies from the 1950s through to the 1980s when India worked to lift itself from hunger and poverty 30 Other classic Bollywood tropes in the film include the fantasy sequences and the montage sequence where the brothers jump off a train and suddenly they are seven years older 29 The producer s first choice for the role of Prem Kumar was Shahrukh Khan 31 an established Bollywood star and host of the 2007 series of Kaun Banega Crorepati the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire However Khan turned down the role concerned that he did not want to give his audience the impression that the real show was a fraud by playing a fraudulent host in the movie 32 Despite the film s success Khan said that he does not regret turning down the role 31 and has been a vociferous supporter of the film to its critics 33 Paul Smith the executive producer of Slumdog Millionaire and the chairman of Celador Films previously owned the international rights to Who Wants to Be a Millionaire 34 The cinematography was handled by Anthony Dod Mantle using mainly digital cinematography rather than traditional film cinematography It was shot on a digital camera the Silicon Imaging SI 2K video camera in 2K resolution digital video It was the first film to take full advantage of the SI 2K digital camera 35 Soundtrack edit Main article Slumdog Millionaire Music from the Motion Picture The Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack was composed by A R Rahman who planned the score for over two months and completed it in two weeks 36 Danny Boyle has said that he chose Rahman because not only does he draw on Indian classical music but he s got R B and hip hop coming in from America house music coming in from Europe and this incredible fusion is created 29 Rahman won the 2009 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and won two Academy Awards one for Best Original Score and one for Best Original Song for Jai Ho Rahman had two songs nominated for Best Original Song the nomination for O Saya was shared with M I A while the win for Jai Ho was shared with lyricist Gulzar The soundtrack was

Millionaire was met with critical acclaim The film holds a 91 approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 290 reviews with an average score of 8 4 10 The consensus reads Visually dazzling and emotionally resonant Slumdog Millionaire is a film that s both entertaining and powerful 82 On Metacritic the film has an average score of 86 out of 100 based on 36 reviews indicating universal acclaim 83 Movie City News shows that the film appeared in 123 different top ten lists out of 286 different critics lists surveyed the 4th most mentions on a top ten list of any film released in 2008 84 Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film four out of four stars calling it a breathless exciting story heartbreaking and exhilarating 85 Wall Street Journal critic Joe Morgenstern refers to Slumdog Millionaire as the film world s first globalised masterpiece 86 Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post argues that this modern day rags to rajah fable won the audience award at the Toronto International Film Festival earlier this year and it s easy to see why With its timely setting of a swiftly globalising India and more specifically the country s own version of the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire TV show combined with timeless melodrama and a hardworking orphan who withstands all manner of setbacks Slumdog Millionaire plays like Charles Dickens for the 21st century 87 Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times describes the film as a Hollywood style romantic melodrama that delivers major studio satisfactions in an ultra modern way and a story of star crossed romance that the original Warner brothers would have embraced shamelessly pulling out stops that you wouldn t think anyone would have the nerve to attempt any more 88 Anthony Lane of the New Yorker stated There is a mismatch here Boyle and his team headed by the director of photography Anthony Dod Mantle clearly believe that a city like Mumbai with its shifting skyline and a population of more than fifteen million is as ripe for storytelling as Dickens s London At the same time the story they chose is sheer fantasy not in its glancing details but in its emotional momentum How else could Boyle get away with assembling his cast for a Bollywood dance number at a railroad station over the closing credits You can either chide the film at this point for relinquishing any claim to realism or you can go with the flow surely the wiser choice 89 Colm Andrew of the Manx Independent was also full of praise saying the film successfully mixes hard hitting drama with uplifting action and the Who Wants To Be a Millionaire show is an ideal device to revolve events around 90 Several other reviewers have described Slumdog Millionaire as a Bollywood style masala movie 91 due to the way the film combines familiar raw ingredients into a feverish masala 92 and culminates in the romantic leads finding each other 93 Other critics offered more mixed reviews For example Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film three out of five stars stating that despite the extravagant drama and some demonstrations of the savagery meted out to India s street children this is a cheerfully undemanding and unreflective film with a vision of India that if not touristy exactly is certainly an outsider s view it depends for its full enjoyment on not being taken too seriously He also pointed out that the film is co produced by Celador who own the rights to the original Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and claimed that it functions as a feature length product placement for the programme 4 A few critics outright panned it Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle states that Slumdog Millionaire has a problem in its storytelling The movie unfolds in a start and stop way that kills suspense leans heavily on flashbacks and robs the movie of most of its velocity T he whole construction is tied to a gimmicky narrative strategy that keeps Slumdog Millionaire from really hitting its stride until the last 30 minutes By then it s just a little too late 94 Eric Hynes of IndieWire called it bombastic a noisy sub Dickens update on the romantic tramp s tale and a goofy picaresque to rival Forrest Gump in its morality and romanticism 95 Reactions from India and the Indian diaspora edit Main article Reactions from India and the Indian diaspora to Slumdog Millionaire Slumdog Millionaire has been a subject of discussion among a variety of people in India and the Indian diaspora Some film critics have responded positively to the film others objected to issues such as Jamal s use of British English or the fact that similar films by Indian filmmakers have not received equal recognition A few notable filmmakers such as Aamir Khan and Priyadarshan have been critical of the film Author and critic Salman Rushdie argues that it has a patently ridiculous conceit 96 Adoor Gopalakrishnan one of the most acclaimed film makers in India during the 1980s and 1990s and a five time Best Director winner of the Indian National Film Awards lambasted Slumdog Millionaire calling it in an interview to NDTV A very anti Indian film All the bad elements of Bombay s commercial cinema are put together and in a very slick way And it underlines and endorses what the West thinks about us It is falsehood built upon falsehood And at every turn is fabricated At every turn it is built on falsehood I was ashamed to see it was being appreciated widely in the west Fortunately Indians are turning it down 97 Academic criticism edit See also Controversial issues surrounding Slumdog Millionaire The film has been subject to serious academic criticism Mitu Sengupta 2009 and 2010 raises substantial doubts about both the realism of the film s portrayal of urban poverty in India and whether the film will assist those arguing for the poor Rather Sengupta argues the film s reductive view of such slums is likely to reinforce negative attitudes to those who live there The film is therefore likely to support policies that have tended to further dispossess the slum dwellers in terms of material goods power and dignity The film it is also suggested celebrates characters and places that might be seen as symbolic of Western culture and models of development 98 99 Ana Cristina Mendes 2010 places Boyle s film in the context of the aestheticising and showcasing of poverty in India for artistic and commercial purposes and proceeds to examine the modes of circulation of these representations in the field of cultural production as well as their role in enhancing the processes of ever increasing consumption of India related images 100 However there are others who point to the changing urban aspirations and prospects for mobility that can be seen in Indian cities such as Mumbai in which the film is set The film is seen by D Parthasarathy 2009 as reflecting a larger context of global cultural flows which implicates issues of labour status ascription achievement and poverty in urban India Parthasarathy 2009 argues for a better understanding of issues of dignity of labour and that the film should be interpreted in a more nuanced way as reflecting the role of market forces and India s new service economy in transforming the caste and status determined opportunity structure in urban India 101 Academic criticism has also been extended to the underlying philosophy of the film with its apparent ends justify means message 102 Many elements of the film including the apparent redemption of Salim at the end of his life and the film s subjugation of the suffering of peripheral characters to the romantic aspirations of Jamal are characteristic say such critics of a naïve Providence based vision of reality 102 Notes edit i Specifically in the Kumar article Boyle referred to Deewaar 1975 by Yash Chopra and Salim Javed Satya 1998 and Company 2002 by Ram Gopal Verma and Black Friday 2007 by Anurag Kashyap ii Some of the other Indian films cited by Boyle as reference points for the film include Satyajit Ray s Pather Panchali 1955 Mira Nair films such as Salaam Bombay 1988 Ashutosh Gowarikar s Lagaan 2001 and Aamir Khan s Taare Zameen Par 2007 iii Fox Searchlight Pictures distributed Slumdog Millionaire theatrically in the United States under a shared distribution agreement with Warner Bros Pictures 39 Pathé themselves distributed the film in its native United Kingdom the studio s native France and through their own distribution division in Switzerland named Monopole Pathé 103 while other independent distributors released the film in other territories See also edit List of
